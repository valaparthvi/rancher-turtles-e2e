# Usage: encrypt-artifact.sh <source-dir> <output-file>
#
# The passphrase is read from the LOG_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable.
# The archive is never gzipped: the upload step compresses it anyway, and the
# largest payload -- Cypress videos -- is already-compressed mp4.
#
# A missing source directory is not an error: nothing is written and the caller's
# upload step skips the artifact via "if-no-files-found: ignore".
