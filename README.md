# rancher-turtles-e2e

[![UI-E2E_head_2.14](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-turtles-e2e/actions/workflows/ui-e2e.yaml/badge.svg?event=schedule)](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-turtles-e2e/actions/workflows/ui-e2e.yaml)

What tests are doing:
1. Create the infra stack ( GCP runner, cert-manager, rancher )
2. Install the Turtles chart with locally built latest chart
3. Deploy the Turtles UI extension
4. Test the Turtles menu, namespaces import features
5. Perform CAPI setup prerequisites
6. Create & Import CAPI cluster using fleet by cluster, namespace annotation
7. Install App on imported CAPI cluster
8. Scale the imported CAPI cluster
9. Remove & Delete the imported CAPI cluster
10. Migration test from 2.12 to 2.13 to test turtles migration from an external chart(2.12) to system integrated chart(
    2.13). These tests are only supported with `dev=true` options; `dev=true` is applicable to 2.13.
11. Upgrade tests from 2.13 to 2.14 to test Turtles & CAPI upgrade from v1.10 to v1.12.
12. Add Feature Switch test for 2.13 to test switch between `embedded-cluster-api` and `turtles` features switch.

## Running the tests locally

### Pre-requisites
1. Install Rancher.
2. Install Rancher Turtles chart.
3. Install CAPI UI Extension.

### Running the test
1. `cd tests/cypress/latest`
2. Install Cypress and its dependencies: `npm install`
3. Export the following ENV VAR: `RANCHER_URL` (format: `https://<FQDN>/dashboard`), `RANCHER_PASSWORD`, `RANCHER_USER`,
   `GREPTAGS=@install [@short @full @upgrade @migration | @vsphere ]`, and provider specific env var:
    1. CAPA - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    2. CAPG - `GCP_CREDENTIALS` and `GCP_PROJECT`
    3. CAPZ - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.
    4. CAPV - `VSPHERE_ENDPOINTS_LIST` (workflow only, otherwise hardcoded endpoint_ip is part of the following var), `VSPHERE_SECRETS_JSON_BASE64`, see [here](tests/cypress/latest/e2e/capv_rke2_cluster.spec.ts#L15) for reference.
4. Start Cypress: `./node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open -C cypress.config.ts` or `npx cypress open --env grepTags="@install @short"`

The Cypress GUI should now be visible.

# Test structure
We primarily categorize our tests using tags such as `short`, `full`, `vsphere`, and `install`. 
Tests tagged with `short` are local (docker-based) tests, while those tagged with `vsphere` are specific to vSphere.
Tests tagged with `full` are cloud provider-based tests. The `install` tag is used for initial setup tests ('install' tag is also to be included in setup tests title).

Additional tags that are supported:

| Tag          | Test                                                                                                  |

# Running tests using Cypress grep
We have implemented tags for more precise selection of tests using a Cypress plugin called [cypress-grep](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/grep)

Note: the title can be either at `describe`, `context` or `it` level.

By default, daily runs will run test with the tags`@install`, `@short`

To use locally use the tag `--env grepTags=tag` along with the npx command

For example:
```
npx cypress run -C cypress.config.ts  --env grepTags="@short" cypress/e2e/*.spec.ts
```

# Test artifacts

CI runs upload three kinds of artifact:

| Artifact                                            | Contents                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `logs-and-screenshots-<run_number>.tar.gz.gpg`      | Cypress screenshots and the collected cluster logs |
| `cypress-videos-<run_number>.tar.gpg`               | Cypress videos                                     |
| `cypress-videos-after-upgrade-<run_number>.tar.gpg` | Cypress videos from `@migration`/`@upgrade` runs   |

All are tarballs encrypted with GPG symmetric AES256, using the `LOG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` repository
secret as the passphrase — ask a repository admin if you need it. Video archives are not gzipped,
since Cypress writes already-compressed mp4.

To inspect one after downloading:
```
gpg --decrypt logs-and-screenshots-123.tar.gpg | tar -xv
gpg --decrypt cypress-videos-123.tar.gpg | tar -xv
```
